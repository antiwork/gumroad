# frozen_string_literal: true

# Server-authoritative policy boundary for the client-confirmed Intent path (Lane B). Given a cart's
# sellers and product lifecycle, it decides whether the cart may confirm client-side and which Stripe
# payment methods it may use. The frontend cannot widen this: payment_method_types is the intersection
# of the eligible set with a hardcoded launched set, so no client-supplied value can add a method.
#
# Two method sets are distinguished:
#   - eligible_payment_method_types: the policy set the cart *could* use (the eligibility-by-product-type
#     policy). This is the logged decision and what later units intersect with per-method launch/PPP gates.
#   - payment_method_types: what Stripe actually receives on the client-confirmed path today. Only card
#     is launched, because the other methods need machinery that isn't built yet: redirect methods need
#     the server return page + allow_redirects, delayed-notification methods need the PaymentIntent
#     webhook lifecycle, and inline wallets/Link need frontend verification. Widening
#     LAUNCHED_PAYMENT_METHOD_TYPES is a later unit's job.
#
# Handshake note: the deferred PaymentIntent's payment_method_types must equal the Payment Element's or
# Stripe rejects the ConfirmationToken (which is payment_method_types-scoped, so it also can't be
# confirmed against an automatic_payment_methods intent — hence an explicit array here, never
# automatic_payment_methods). Both sides read this resolver, but they derive its lifecycle inputs
# independently (the presenter from the cart, PreparePaymentIntentService from the persisted purchases).
# Today that can't diverge because card survives every filter, so both land on ["card"]. When LAUNCHED
# widens, those two derivations must be reconciled — and PreparePaymentIntentService hard-stops an
# ineligible cart before creating the intent, so any residual mismatch fails closed rather than reaching
# Stripe with the wrong method list.
